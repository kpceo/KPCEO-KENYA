                    <H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
					<p>The global report shows that 90% of the total pastors and other vulnerable groups of people like needy children, youths among others live under extreme poverty with serious problems that range from lack of financial income, food, medical care, children’s education support, transport e t c to cater for themselves and the church. Pastors in Kenya are also not exempted from the same problems.
                        The core value of the church is modeling responsible God fearing, hardworking people and leaders in the country as well in the whole world. This has helped in solving family and tribal disputes, transforming societies from immorality to good morals, correcting governments through condemning leaders and uniting the country, to mention but few.
                        However, the church’s buildings, the servants, worshipers and surrounding communities have remained in serious problems with poor conditions that have led to their mockery and laughter. These problems also have been largely exposed out by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic which left small churches closed, pastors, needy families, disabled and elderly starving with no food, lack of medical care and many more.
                        </p>
                    <P>In today’s world, most of the churches that are temporarily built are in a bad state of falling risking the lives of people in rural while others in in urban areas are of rentals. This has made worshipers fear for their lives and loss of hope in rental churches that are always in the state of vacation.  Also pastors have become poorer in that they cannot meet their family and church needs, needy children, youths, farmers, disabled, elderly and family couples have remained poorer that they only live by a meal a day even can go two to three days without food, lack of enough food production due lack of finance and modern farming technology, limited opportunities for education and trainings, viable employment, health and social services. Also communities in arid and Semi-arid regions have remained suffering with the problem of lack of enough clean safe water for drinking and use for both people and animals and some for irrigation of plants.
                        The Organization is focusing on empowering the most underprivileged vulnerable groups of people and churches in different communities of Kenya through; building permanent church structures, installing instruments and spiritual materials and also supporting pastors with finances that they may cater for their needs I e housing, transport, medical, food, education of pastor’s children e t c; providing safe clean water to communities through drilling boreholes; supporting farmers with farm inputs and new modern farming technology and agribusiness; catering for the needs of vulnerable groups of people I e needy children, persons living with disabilities, elderly persons, youths, poor family couples hence changing their lives socially, spiritually, financially and economically.
                        This proposed project is to present in 15000 most underprivileged vulnerable groups of people like pastors, needy children, persons living with disabilities, elderly persons, youths, poor farmers, family couples from different communities in Nairobi County and other counties in Kenya who will benefit from it through empowerment programs like entrepreneurship, transportation support, life skills, education support, farm inputs and new modern farming technology, agribusiness, food support e t c. These empowerment programs through entrepreneurship and financial support will create economic growth and improvement of pastoral families and community. And also supporting pastors with housing and transportation means will remove rental costs and lack of pastoral houses and reduce transport costs for pastors to reach the unreachable hence saving lost souls .Food, farm inputs, finance and agribusiness trainings will increase food production and surplus for sale hence reduction of hunger and malnutrition problems and improve on family financial status. Drilling of boreholes will provide enough safe clean water for people and animal use as well as irrigation hence reduction of water shortages and diseases in communities. Finally education and life skills trainings will eradicate illiteracy and lead to upbringing of hardworking responsible citizens in the country hence leading to economic development of the country. To consider the spiritual, social and financial needs of these communities, the proposed project program is achievable, economically possible and environmentally healthy. The proposed project will be implemented in a period of 5 years and will need 50 billion US. Dollars which taking into consideration the purpose it will serve for the society is a justified amount.
